# videojs-mux

The VideoJS plugin for Mux Analytics

## Using

Install the package:

`npm install videojs-mux`

Include videojs-mux where needed, e.g.:

`import 'videojs-mux';`

There is no need to make any direct calls to `videojs-mux`, as it will register itself as a videojs plugin.

See our [docs page](https://docs.mux.com) for instructions to initialize the plugin.

## Using directly in an HTML page

The above directions are for including within an NPM project. If, however, you want to include the script file directly in a web page, make sure that you use the `/node_modules/videojs-mux/dist/videojs-mux.js` file in your `<script>` tag.
